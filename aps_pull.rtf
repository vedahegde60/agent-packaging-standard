1. Website Polis\
- I have to not setup a site yet. Plan is to register agentpackaging.org and build the site\
- Focus on \'93information architecture and technical polish\'94\
\
2. Blog Post + Dev Marketing\
- Primary audience will be developer community, enterprise leaders. It is meant to be an open source where we invite developers to contribute to this cause - As mentioned in my 30 sec pitch\
- Tone preference should be - ecosystem-vision\
- Refer to GitHub link for key visuals and diagrams - https://github.com/vedahegde60/agent-packaging-standard/tree/main - This link is not public yet\
\
3. Publish Examples to Registry\
- We built this registry until week3. Review zip file for all the documentation \
- Right now, we have just two examples echo-agent and rag-agent\
- We need to polish documentation folder so that the documents are release ready\
\
4. Announcement Wave 1\
- Technical community, early adopters. Not sure what you mean by public preview. I think any developers interested in contributing should be able to contribute\
- Yes, we need to make announcement narrative. I don\'92t have X account or Discord account. We need to come up with a best method to communicate in other channels other than LinkedIn\

\cf0 Website ( agentpackaging.org )\
1. I don\'92t have a tech stack. Starting from scratch\
2. Static informational content\
3. I don\'92t know if I need netlify or vercel at this point. I am just planning to get domain name and host it in cloudfare and point to GitHub for now. Let me know if you have other ideas. \
Blog and Dev Marketing\
4. Separate post - \'93Introducing Agent Packaging Standard\'94 and agentpackaging.org should support this cause. Agent packaging.org is not a startup or we are not promoting this website. We are promoting the standard\
5. Yes, I need cross-posting snippet. Let me know your thoughts on if I should get an X and discord account and post on those channels. I do have slack account, let me know if I should publish there in addition to LinkedIn and GitHub Readme. \
Examples & Docs\
6. Readme, Usage, Interop and License documents are more relevant to aps or Agent Packaging Standard. Examples are there just to show how this standard would help\
7. Release-read for public contributors and also technical reference. I think the content is already there we just need to make sure it reads well and intuitive for people to read and understand and contribute to take this standard to the next level\
8. All three + suggest if I should get X account and discord account\
9. Start with call for contributors. If I have traction, I can talk about roadmap and also roadmap is part of the docs in GitHub\
Yes, please do unpack docs.zip and review the content. Tell me if such a standard will be useful for the agent developer community. \
